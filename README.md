This Project was created for learning purposes only, and is part of The Odin Project Curriculum. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The purpose for implementing this webpage was to learn how to access and extract information from an API. The API that I used is provided by openweathermap.org. Another purpose for making this page was to learn Asynchronous Javascript, using Async/await and fetch methods.
